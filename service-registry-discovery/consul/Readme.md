# Hashicrop Consul (https://www.consul.io/) has the following features:
- Service Discovery: 
Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. Register external services such as SaaS providers as well.
- Multi Datacenter: 
Consul scales to multiple datacenters out of the box with no complicated configuration. Look up services in other datacenters, or keep the request local.
- Failure Detection: 
Pairing service discovery with health checking prevents routing requests to unhealthy hosts and enables services to easily provide circuit breakers.
- Key Value Storage: 
Flexible key/value store for dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election and more. Long poll for near-instant notification of configuration changes.
