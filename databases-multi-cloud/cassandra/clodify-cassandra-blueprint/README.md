# demoCassandraBlueprint
a Cloudify blueprint to demonstrate orchestrating a Cassandra cluster

# Apache Cassandra
- The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.

## Features
* Deploys a cluster of DataStax Community distribution of Apache Cassandraâ„¢ 2.1
* Cluster created in an Amazon VPC environment with customizable Security Group
* Supports both RPM based (RHEL, CentOS) and DEB based (Ubuntu) configurations
* Also installs DataStax OpsCenter for cluster visualization and monitoring
* Supports the scale workflow of Cloudify to expand the Cassandra cluster on demand

## Requirements
* Cloudify version 3.3.1
* AWS plugin version 1.4
  * Cloudify 3.3.0 and AWS plugin 1.3 are insufficient as they lack VPC support

## Scaling
* The cluster will consist of one seed node and one or more peer nodes
  * By default, it will start as a 2 node cluster: 1 seed and 1 peer node
* A running cluster can be expanded after deployment
  * To do so, execute the scale workflow built in to Cloudify with cassandra_peer_host as the node_id
  * Apply a positive delta to increase or negative delta in order to decrease cluster nodes
