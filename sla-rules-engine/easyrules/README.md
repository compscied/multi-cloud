## What is Easy Rules?

Easy Rules is a Java rules engine inspired by an article called *"[Should I use a Rules Engine?](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/RulesEngine.html)"* by [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) in which he says:

> You can build a simple rules engine yourself. All you need is to create a bunch of objects with conditions and actions, store them in a collection, and run through them to evaluate the conditions and execute the actions.

This is exactly what Easy Rules does, it provides the `Rule` abstraction to create rules with conditions and actions, and the `RulesEngine` API that runs through a set of rules to evaluate conditions and execute actions.

## Core features

 * Lightweight library and easy to learn API

 * POJO based development with annotation programming model

 * Useful abstractions to define business rules and apply them easily with Java

 * The ability to create composite rules from primitive ones

 * Dynamic rule configuration at runtime using JMX
